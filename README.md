===================
*Not officially released --- have an IE grid issue to resolve*
Statamic Theme for Gaming Bloggers


This theme is based off of the baseline <a href="https://github.com/statamicthemes/statarkers-theme">theme</a> put together by Garth Redfern. It uses the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com"> Bootstrap Framework</a>. The theme requires a Statamic license which is purchase-able from their <a href="http://www.statamic.com/">website</a>. Special thanks to Jason Varga for the <a href="https://github.com/pixelfear/Statamic-Globals">global addon</a>. It was designed by <a href="http://stephaniehider.com">Stephanie Hider</a> for a gaming buddy who tinkers, not in the good way, with his <a href="http://aldshotfirst.com"> gaming blog too much</a>. =D.

The demo can be found at <a href="http://ares.themegoodness.com/"> here </a>

The global addon needs to be installed to take advantage of this theme please follow the directions at the link above on how to enable this add on. To take advantage of the comments you will need to install [https://github.com/statamic/Plugin-Disqus] (disqus).

Please copy over the files found in the folders: <br />
_config/fieldsets <br />
_content/<br />
_themes/<br />
assets

In the _config/settings.yaml you will want to change the theme to "themegoodness_ares" also please make sure your site url is correct and active for the author fieldset to work properly.

If the global addon is installed correctly in your admin you should see the global tab here you can modify the theme's logo for the header footer, swap out the red colors, add your tracking codes and input your social profile links. There is also a section for the default sidebar items that allow you to turn on and off the sub nav, events and add callouts.

You should see content areas to populate for blog, our team, events and programs. You can delete any of these that you don't wish to use in the content folder. 

And of course if you know your way around Statamic you can easily swap, delete and change things as you need. Please send me a shout if you need any help or find any bugs or issues.
